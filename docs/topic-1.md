# Topic 1: Understanding Cloud Computing ☁️

## What Exactly is Cloud Computing? 🤔

Cloud computing is the practice of using on-demand computing resources as services hosted over the internet 🌐. "Over the internet" is what makes up the cloud part ☁️. It eliminates the need for organizations to find, set up, or manage resources themselves 🏢. And they only pay for what they use 💸.

Cloud computing uses a network to connect users to a cloud platform 🌐. This is a virtual space where they can access and borrow computing services 🖥️. A primary computer handles all communication between devices and servers to share information 🔄. And there are privacy and security measures 🔐 to keep everything safe.

## Picture This: Cloud Computing as a Shared Kitchen 🍳

Here’s another way to think about it 🍴. Imagine cloud computing like a shared kitchen in a rental apartment 🏠, owned by a property management company or, in the case of the cloud, a third-party service host 🤝. The kitchen has many appliances and cooking tools 🍽️, just as the cloud platform has servers, storage, hardware, and software.

So, when someone in the apartment gets hungry, they just go ahead and cook a meal in the well-equipped kitchen 🍔. They don’t each have to buy their own wooden spoons 🍴 or toaster oven 🍞. Likewise, the cloud enables organizations to access computing resources on-demand, without spending time and money buying and maintaining their own storage, hardware, and software 🖥️💰.

## The Cloud Computing Model ☁️: The Infrastructure Breakdown

It’s the unique infrastructure of a cloud computing model that makes all of this possible 🔧. This infrastructure has four main components:

1. **Hardware** 🖥️
2. **Storage** 💾
3. **Network** 🌐
4. **Virtualization** 💻

Let’s break each down:

---

### 1. **Hardware** 🖥️

Types of hardware include:
- Servers 🖥️
- Processors ⚙️
- Memory 🧠
- Network switches, routers, and cables 🌐
- Firewalls and load balancers 🔥
- Cooling systems ❄️
- Power supplies 🔋

These are the physical items needed to keep things running smoothly 🛠️.

---

### 2. **Storage** 💾

Data storage in a cloud computing infrastructure can occur in three main ways:

- **File Storage** 📂: Keeps data in one place and organizes it in a simple, easy-to-understand way through a hierarchy of files in folders. This is the oldest and most widely used data storage system, but it’s a bit cumbersome and can only accomplish so much.

- **Object Storage** 🗂️: Holds unstructured data, along with its metadata. Metadata is just data about data 📊. For example, a picture taken with a smartphone 📱 might contain information about the location 🌍, the date 🗓️, and the type of device 📷 that captured the image.

- **Block Storage** 🧱: Divides large volumes of data into smaller pieces, optimally organized, with unique labels 🏷️. An advantage of block storage is that the data is easily accessible 🔑, but it can be expensive 💰 and has limited capability to handle metadata.

---

### 3. **Network** 🌐

Cloud computing infrastructure needs a way to connect to its backend resources, and this connection is made possible through a network of physical hardware 🔌. Through this network, users tap into cloud resources using some of the hardware mentioned earlier, including routers and firewalls 🔐. 

Basically, the physical network setup is what enables the virtual one to operate 🚀.

---

### 4. **Virtualization** 💻

Virtualization is technology that creates a virtual version of physical infrastructure, like servers, storage, and networks 🔄. This is what lets the service work without a direct connection. It enables resources to be accessed on demand, without the need for specific hardware to be involved 🖥️.

## The 3 Cloud Computing Models 🌐

It’s really important to know that there are **three primary models** to choose from, each offering a different level of flexibility and control 🤖. These models are:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** 🖥️
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** 🛠️
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)** 🧑‍💻

---

### 1. **IaaS** - Infrastructure as a Service 🖥️

**IaaS** offers on-demand access to IT infrastructure services, including hardware, storage, network, and virtualization tools 🔌. With IaaS, a service provider hosts, maintains, and updates the infrastructure 🛠️. Your organization manages everything else, such as your operating system, data, and applications 🔍.

An IaaS model provides the **highest level of control** over IT resources, similar to traditional on-premises IT 🏢.

**Example:** Cloud storage, like emails you’ve sorted into an online folder 📂.

**Metaphor:** Think of IaaS like leasing a car 🚗. You pick the infrastructure you want, use it for the contracted period, but you do not own it 🏷️.

---

### 2. **PaaS** - Platform as a Service 🛠️

**PaaS** provides hardware and software tools to create an environment for developing cloud applications 🧑‍💻. It simplifies the application-development process, so your organization can focus solely on app development without the hassle of managing the underlying infrastructure 🛠️.

Your developers can create, test, troubleshoot, launch, host, and maintain the app all on the platform 🧑‍💻.

**Metaphor:** PaaS is like hopping into a taxi 🚖 and telling the driver where to take you. You're not behind the wheel, but you trust the driver to get you to your destination 🗺️.

---

### 3. **SaaS** - Software as a Service 🧑‍💻

**SaaS** provides users with a **licensed subscription** to a complete software package 💻. This includes infrastructure, maintenance, and updates, all managed by the service provider 🔧. 

You simply connect to the app through the internet 🌐. Other users may also have access to use the same services.

**Metaphor:** SaaS is like riding a bus 🚌. You pick your stop from preset routes, and you share the ride with other passengers 🚏.
